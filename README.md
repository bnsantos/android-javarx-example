JavaRx Android Example
======================

This simple application was built using the [Reactive Extensions for Android](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) to show current US movies in theaters using [Rotten Tomatoes API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/). 

The movie list is also stored locally on device using a SQLite db with [ormlite](http://ormlite.com/sqlite_java_android_orm.shtml).
